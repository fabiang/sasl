Provides code to generate responses to common SASL mechanisms, including:
* Digest-MD5
* Cram-MD5
* Plain
* Anonymous
* Login (Pseudo mechanism)
* SCRAM

Full refactored version of the the original [Auth_SASL2 Pear package](http://pear.php.net/package/Auth_SASL2/).

## Installation

The easiest way to install fabiang/sasl is by using Composer:

```
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
composer require fabiang/sasl
```

## Usage

Use the factory method to create a authentication mechanism object:

```php
use Fabiang\Sasl\Sasl;

$factory = new Sasl;

$mechanism = $factory->factory('SCRAM-SHA-1', array(
    'authcid'  => 'username',
    'secret'   => 'password',
    'authzid'  => 'authzid', // optional. Username to proxy as
    'service'  => 'servicename', // optional. Name of the service
    'hostname' => 'hostname', // optional. Hostname of the service
));

$response = $mechanism->createResponse();
```

Challenge-based authentication mechanisms implement the interface
`Fabiang\Sasl\Authentication\ChallengeAuthenticationInterface`.
For those mechanisms call the method again with the challenge:

```php
$response = $mechanism->createResponse($challenge);
```

**Note**: The challenge must be Base64 decoded.

### SCRAM verification

To verify the data returned by the server for SCRAM you can call:

```php
$mechanism->verify($data);
```

If the method returns false you should disconnect.

### Required options

List of options required by authentication mechanisms.
For mechanisms that are challenge-based you'll need to call `createResponse()`
again and send the returned value to the server.

| Mechanism  | Authcid | Secret | Authzid  | Service | Hostname | Challenge |
| ---------- | ------- | ------ | -------- | ------- | -------- | --------- |
| Anonymous  | yes     | no     | no       | no      | no       | no        |
| Cram-MD5   | yes     | yes    | no       | no      | no       | yes       |
| Digest-MD5 | yes     | yes    | optional | yes     | yes      | yes       |
| External   | no      | no     | yes      | no      | no       | no        |
| Login      | yes     | yes    | no       | no      | no       | no        |
| Plain      | yes     | yes    | optional | no      | no       | no        |
| SCRAM-*    | yes     | yes    | optional | no      | no       | yes       |

## Unit tests

If you like this library and you want to contribute, make sure the unit tests
and integration tests are running.

Run the unit tests:

```
./vendor/bin/phpunit
```

## Integration tests

The integration tests verify the authentication methods against an Ejabberd and Dovecot server.

### Docker Compose

To launch the servers you can use the provided Docker Compose file.
Just [install Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) and run:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

**Note:** ejabberd takes around *ten minutes* to start.

### Vagrant

To launch the servers you can use the provided Vagrant box.
Just [install Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads) and run:

```
vagrant up
```

After some minutes you'll have the runnig server instances inside of a virtual machine.

### RUN

Now you can run the integration tests:

```
./vendor/bin/behat
```
